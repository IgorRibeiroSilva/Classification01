This will be a simple project for studies purposes.
I will make a classification program using machine learning techniques.

For those who are interested in use these codes for study, 
we recommend follow this order bellow to a better understanding:

1 - Classification.py is a simple classification program where we can classify animals in birds or snakes using 
    Naive Bayes multinomial algorithm.

2 - In ClassificationUsingCSV.py the classification task is made reading a CSV file.
    *Files related:
        -dataSnake.csv
        -readCSV.py

3 - In CategoricClassification.py we classify and compare our algorithm performance with a base algorithm (benchmark)
    This also is a more generic program.

        -categoricData.csv
        -readCSV.py
