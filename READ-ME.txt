This will be a simple project for studies purposes.
I will make a classification program using machine learning techniques, at first, bayesian methods.

- Classification.py is a simple classification program where we can classify animals in birds or snakes using 
Naive Bayes multinomial algorithm.

- In ClassificationUsingCSV.py tha classification task is made reading a CSV file.
